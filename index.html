            <h4>Year 2018 - now</h4>
            <p>
              I joined the current company I work for - <a href="https://dreamorbit.com" target="_blank">DreamOrbit</a>, Bangalore in Nov 2018 as a senior UI developer.
              Here i am working for the client <a href="https://www.acacompliancegroup.com" target="_blank">ACA Group</a>.
              We have close to 5 angular apps residing in a mono repository. Here are some things that I have done so far
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Created shared library projects to house components shared between different apps.
                  Used <a href="https://nx.dev/l/a/getting-started/nx-cli">nx cli</a> to create library projects
                </li>
                <li>
                  Updated the <code>tsconfig.json</code> files for apps to use custom package namespaces
                </li>
                <li>
                  Used ngrx for application state management
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extensively used RxJS for managing multiple api calls and synchronizing the same using different operators
                </li>
                <li>
                  Customized <code>angular.json</code> to re-use css styles from shared library in different apps
                </li>
                <li>
                  PR reviews and mentored junior devs
                </li>
                <li>Tools and libraries used - Angular v12, Material components, ngrx, nrwl, devextreme library for angular, lodash etc.</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Year 2017 - 2018</h4>
            <p>
              In 2017 I got technically sound with Html, CSS and Javascript first and then Angular v2+.
              This year I started working for Time Inc India (now <a href="https://www.meredith.com" target="_blank">Meredith</a>).
              Here I worked on an internal app which was a revamp of and existing app which was in Silverlight that allowed permissioning for a user different modules.
              I built the app from scratch using Angular v4.
              Since there was a requirement to use a grid, Kendo UI for jQuery was used.
              So i had to use jQuery along with angular (strange right?).
              Here are key highlights of what I implemented for the app
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implemented a custom state service to manage the state of the app
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implemented a custom publish subscribe pattern using <code>EventEmitter</code> class to pass data around different components
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created a custom auto-complete search component to search users that used RxJS operators for seamless integration with api to avoid multiple api calls
                </li>
                <li>
                  Had to write custom logic to bootstrap the angular app on demand based on whether or not the user was authorized
                </li>
                <li>
                  Had to write custom logic to bootstrap the angular app on demand based on whether or not the user was authorized
                </li>
                <li>
                  Used <a href="https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer" target="_blank">source-map-explorer</a> to analyze the Javascript modules included in final app bundle files 
                </li>

              Here I learned to build rich internet UI applications using the then popular Adobe Flex framework which was based on Adobe Flash platform and Actionscript language.
              I worked as an Adobe Flex consultant with many clients

          <summary>How I got in to UI development</summary>
          <section>
              <p>
              Back in 2006 i was a full stack web app developer and used Java and its Struts framework.
              After working for a year or so as a full stack dev, i realized i enjoyed working more on UI.
              So i left the job in Aug 2007 to persue a 6 months multimedia course - Diploma in Advanced Computer Arts from the government institute C-DAC from Mumbai.
              There I learned about 2D, 3D animation, image editing, website designing and Flash based animation and website development.
              Of all the things i learned, the one thing that got me hooked is Adobe Flash (then known as Macromedia).
              I instantly liked it. Adobe Flash worked on Actionscript language (which is based on ECMAScript standard).
              That was easy to learn as I was already familiar with Java.
              I completed the course in Feb 2008 and was immediately recruited by Tekno Point Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai.
              Here I started working on Adobe Flash platform which handled all the aspects of UI development.
              Then i got introduced to the Adobe Flex (now <a href="https://flex.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Flex</a>) framework which was used to build rich ui enterprise apps.
              For long time to come, i worked with this framework till May 2016

              After Adobe donated the Flex framework to Apache Software Foundation in 2011 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex" target="_blank">more info here</a>),
              its use to develop rich web applications gradually declined.
              At the time, I was working with a company called ServiceMax, Bangalore which is into field service management.
              I worked as a consultant there. I worked on 3 apps based on Adobe Flex.
              One of the apps called Dispatch Console was using Google Maps (Flash version) to display the routes for a field technician.
              After Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/google-abandons-maps-api-for-flash/">announced</a> the deprecation of Flash version for the maps,
              I had to migrate the Flash version of maps to javascript version.
              In other words, i had to create a hybrid app which used Flash and Javascript both.
              And I thought now is the good time to switch to Html, CSS & JS completely.
              Hence began a new journey to learn Javascript. I started off with The Definitive Guide 6th Edition by David Flanagan and never looked back ðŸ˜….
              I waved good bye to Flex in May 2016 ðŸ˜¢
