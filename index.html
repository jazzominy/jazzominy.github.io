          <h4>Year 2017 - 2018</h4>
          <p>
            In 2017 I got technically sound with Html, CSS and Javascript first and then Angular v2+.
            This year I started working for Time Inc India (now Meredith Corporation).
            Here I worked on an internal app which was a revamp of and existing app which was in Silverlight that allowed permissioning for a user different modules.
            I built the app from scratch using Angular v4.
            Since there was a requirement to use a grid, Kendo UI for jQuery was used.
            So i had to use jQuery along with angular (strange right?).
            Here are key highlights of what I implemented for the app
            <ul>
              <li>
                Implemented a custom state service to manage the state of the app
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented a custom publish subscribe pattern using <code>EventEmitter</code> class to pass data around different components
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a custom auto-complete search component to search users that used RxJS operators for seamless integration with api to avoid multiple api calls
              </li>
              <li>
                Had to write custom logic to bootstrap the angular app on demand based on whether or not the user was authorized
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Used <a href="https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer">source-map-explorer</a> to analyze the Javascript modules included in final app bundle files 
              </li>
            </ul>

        <summary>How I got in to UI development</summary>
        <section>
            <p>
            Back in 2006 i was a full stack web app developer and used Java and its Struts framework.
            After working for a year or so as a full stack dev, i realized i enjoyed working more on UI.
            So i left the job in Aug 2007 to persue a 6 months multimedia course - Diploma in Advanced Computer Arts from the government institute C-DAC from Mumbai.
            There I learned about 2D, 3D animation, image editing, website designing and Flash based animation and website development.
            Of all the things i learned, the one thing that got me hooked is Adobe Flash (then known as Macromedia).
            I instantly liked it. Adobe Flash worked on Actionscript language (which is based on ECMAScript standard).
            That was easy to learn as I was already familiar with Java.
            I completed the course in Feb 2008 and was immediately recruited by Tekno Point Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai.
            Here I started working on Adobe Flash platform which handled all the aspects of UI development.
            Then i got introduced to the Adobe Flex (now <a href="https://flex.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Flex</a>) framework which was used to build rich ui enterprise apps.
            For long time to come, i worked with this framework till May 2016

        <summary>New beginnings post May 2016</summary>
        <section>
          <p>
            After Adobe donated the Flex framework to Apache Software Foundation in 2011 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex" target="_blank">more info here</a>),
            its use to develop rich web applications gradually declined.
            At the time, I was working with a company called ServiceMax, Bangalore which is into field service management.
            I worked as a consultant there. I worked on 3 apps based on Adobe Flex.
            One of the apps called Dispatch Console was using Google Maps (Flash version) to display the routes for a field technician.
            After Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/google-abandons-maps-api-for-flash/">announced</a> the deprecation of Flash version for the maps,
            I had to migrate the Flash version of maps to javascript version.
            In other words, i had to create a hybrid app which used Flash and Javascript both.
            And I thought now is the good time to switch to Html, CSS & JS completely.
            Hence began a new journey to learn Javascript. I started off with The Definitive Guide 6th Edition by David Flanagan and never looked back ðŸ˜….
            I waved good bye to Flex in May 2016 ðŸ˜¢
