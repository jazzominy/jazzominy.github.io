          I am Jasmine, yet another UI developer. I have been in this field for far too long - since 2008.
          Back in the day, Adobe Flex was really popular. All of it was based on Actionscript language.
          And trust me it was real fun developing rich ui enterprise applications using Adobe Flex (now <a href="https://flex.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Flex</a>) framework.
          But soon (around 2015-2016) the framework started seeing a decline in its usage as Html & CSS
          had started to pick up pace in terms of modernization. And i had to say good bye to it ðŸ˜”. I had spent way
          too much time with the technology to not be sad.
          <br><br>
          Anyways, I moved on and embraced Html, CSS & Javascript and the transition was real smooth.
          Once I was proficient enough in these, thanks to this book - JavaScript The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan,
          i explored Angular and here we are.

            <h4>Year 2018 - now</h4>
            <p>
              I joined the current company I work for - <a href="https://dreamorbit.com" target="_blank">DreamOrbit</a>, Bangalore in Nov 2018 as a senior UI developer.
              Here i am working for the client <a href="https://www.acacompliancegroup.com" target="_blank">ACA Group</a>.
              We have close to 5 angular apps residing in a mono repository. Here are some things that I have done so far
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Created shared library projects to house components shared between different apps.
                  Used <a href="https://nx.dev/l/a/getting-started/nx-cli">nx cli</a> to create library projects
                </li>
                <li>
                  Updated the <code>tsconfig.json</code> files for apps to use custom package namespaces
                </li>
                <li>
                  Used ngrx for application state management
                </li>
                <li>
                  Extensively used RxJS for managing multiple api calls and synchronizing the same using different operators
                </li>
                <li>
                  Customized <code>angular.json</code> to re-use css styles from shared library in different apps
                </li>
                <li>
                  PR reviews and mentored junior devs
                </li>
                <li>Tools and libraries used - Angular v12, Material components, ngrx, nrwl, devextreme library for angular, lodash etc.</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Year 2017 - 2018</h4>
            <p>
              In 2017 I got technically sound with Html, CSS and Javascript first and then Angular v2+.
              This year I started working for Time Inc India (now <a href="https://www.meredith.com" target="_blank">Meredith</a>).
              Here I worked on an internal app which was a revamp of and existing app which was in Silverlight that allowed permissioning for a user different modules.
              I built the app from scratch using Angular v4.
              Since there was a requirement to use a grid, Kendo UI for jQuery was used.
              So i had to use jQuery along with angular (strange right?).
              Here are key highlights of what I implemented for the app
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implemented a custom state service to manage the state of the app
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implemented a custom publish subscribe pattern using <code>EventEmitter</code> class to pass data around different components
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created a custom auto-complete search component to search users that used RxJS operators for seamless integration with api to avoid multiple api calls
                </li>
                <li>
                  Had to write custom logic to bootstrap the angular app on demand based on whether or not the user was authorized
                </li>
                <li>
                  Had to write custom logic to bootstrap the angular app on demand based on whether or not the user was authorized
                </li>
                <li>
                  Used <a href="https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer" target="_blank">source-map-explorer</a> to analyze the Javascript modules included in final app bundle files 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Year 2008 - 2016</h4>
            <p>For this period, I worked as a consultant for <a href="https://teknopoint.in" target="_blank">Tekno Point</a>.

          <summary>How I got in to UI development</summary>
          <section>
              <p>
              Back in 2006 i was a full stack web app developer and used Java and its Struts framework.
              After working for a year or so as a full stack dev, i realized i enjoyed working more on UI.
              So i left the job in Aug 2007 to persue a 6 months multimedia course - Diploma in Advanced Computer Arts from the government institute C-DAC from Mumbai.
              There I learned about 2D, 3D animation, image editing, website designing and Flash based animation and website development.
              Of all the things i learned, the one thing that got me hooked is Adobe Flash (then known as Macromedia).
              I instantly liked it. Adobe Flash worked on Actionscript language (which is based on ECMAScript standard).
              That was easy to learn as I was already familiar with Java.
              I completed the course in Feb 2008 and was immediately recruited by Tekno Point Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai.
              Here I started working on Adobe Flash platform which handled all the aspects of UI development.
              Then i got introduced to the Adobe Flex (now <a href="https://flex.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Flex</a>) framework which was used to build rich ui enterprise apps.
              For long time to come, i worked with this framework till May 2016

            <p>
              After Adobe donated the Flex framework to Apache Software Foundation in 2011 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex" target="_blank">more info here</a>),
              its use to develop rich web applications gradually declined.
              At the time, I was working with a company called ServiceMax, Bangalore which is into field service management.
              I worked as a consultant there. I worked on 3 apps based on Adobe Flex.
              One of the apps called Dispatch Console was using Google Maps (Flash version) to display the routes for a field technician.
              After Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/google-abandons-maps-api-for-flash/">announced</a> the deprecation of Flash version for the maps,
              I had to migrate the Flash version of maps to javascript version.
              In other words, i had to create a hybrid app which used Flash and Javascript both.
              And I thought now is the good time to switch to Html, CSS & JS completely.
              Hence began a new journey to learn Javascript. I started off with JavaScript The Definitive Guide 6th Edition by David Flanagan and never looked back ðŸ˜….
              I waved good bye to Flex in May 2016 ðŸ˜¢
