# Source for my blog

This repo is the source for my [blog](https://jazzominy.github.io). It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I have not used any theme, but have created the blog from scratch. I did take refrence from the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page) theme. i also referred to [Lea Verou's blog](https://github.com/LeaVerou/lea.verou.me) for some styling and layout ideas.
